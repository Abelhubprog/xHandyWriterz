# Railway Deployment - Quick Checklist

## ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### Web Service (xHandyWriterz) - FIX 404 ERROR
```
1. Railway â†’ handywriterz-production â†’ xHandyWriterz â†’ Settings
2. Source section â†’ Root Directory
3. Change: /apps/web â†’ .
4. Click: Update
5. Wait for auto-redeploy (or click Deploy â†’ Redeploy)
```

**Expected**: https://xhandywriterz-production.up.railway.app/ shows your React app

### Mattermost Service - CONFIGURE NEW SERVICE
```
1. Railway â†’ handywriterz-production â†’ Mattermost service â†’ Settings
2. Source section â†’ Root Directory = .
3. Config-as-code section â†’ Path = apps/mattermost/railway.json
4. Click: Apply changes
5. Add environment variables (DB, R2 credentials)
6. Deploy service
```

**Expected**: Mattermost login page accessible

## ðŸ“‹ Simple Verification

### Web âœ“
- [ ] Root Directory = `.` (not /apps/web)
- [ ] Redeploy completed
- [ ] Domain loads app (not 404 error)

### Mattermost âœ“
- [ ] Root Directory = `.`
- [ ] Config path = `apps/mattermost/railway.json`
- [ ] Env vars set
- [ ] Deploy succeeded

## ðŸ†˜ If Still Stuck

**Web 404 persists**:
- Double-check Root Directory is exactly `.` (single dot, no slash)
- Force redeploy after changing setting
- Check build logs in Railway

**Mattermost won't start**:
- Verify Postgres connection string
- Check R2 credentials
- Review Mattermost container logs

**Files Ready**: All code committed (f18ba90)  
**Waiting On**: You to update Root Directory in Railway UI  
**Time Required**: ~5 minutes total
